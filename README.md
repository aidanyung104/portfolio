                                <p> Since high school, I have been heavily involved in sports broadcasting. I've directed, producted, operated cameras, graphics, replay, and more for many different networks. Beginning with the Durham Bulls Explorer Post 50 program, I went on to work professionally for WRAL, Duke, UNC, and Sports Media Technology with my work airing on local news networks, ACCN, TSN, and ESPN. </p>

                                <p> I've spent the last four summers at the Durham Bulls. There, I taught other interns about television broadcasting and how to run positions, while also running various positions myself. As a producer, I have cycled through audio, graphics, cameras, replay (3Play), TD, producer and director for different broadcasts. </p>
                                <p> ‎  </p>
                                <p> The Durham Bulls introduced me to broadcasting and I am extremely grateful for the experience and connections they've given me. I was awarded the Post 50 Scholarship in September 2024. </p>

                                <p> In the autumn of my senior year in high school I worked for WRAL's High School OT show, a program which recaps high school football games throughout North Carolina. I primarily ran replay, although occasionally I ran cameras for their broadcast. </p>

                                <p> Also during my senior year, I began working for Blue Devils Network, which broadcasts all home sporting events at Duke. I worked videoboard and digital broadcasts for most sports including Soccer, Field Hockey, Softball, Baseball, Football and Basketball. I have also worked linear broadcasts for Duke Baseball. </p>

                                <p> Hired in fall 2024, I have run graphics support for various NHL teams from SMT's remote control room in Durham, NC. Using the Optics Live and Optics Pro systems, I have learned to tag players with motion-tracked graphics and build replay packages with graphic overlays. These replays are shipped to NHL team broadcasts to be used on air on networks like TSN and ESPN. </p>
